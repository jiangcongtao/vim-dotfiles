# VIM

- The default <leader> key (without let mapleader=) is \
- Find what key is set to <leader> key, in vim/nvim command mode,type :echo mapleader
- Movement under vim command mode
  - Shift-<left arrow> : move left one word
  - Shift-<right arrow>: move right one word
  - Ctrl-a/<Home> : move to beginning
  - Ctrl-e/<End>  : move to end 
  - Ctrl-w : delete word at cursor
  - Ctrl-k : delete all words after cursor
  - Ctrl-u : delete all words before cursor
- Check mappings
  - :h map-listing
  - :h mapping
  - :h :map
  - :map 
  - :verbose map <C-W>*
  - :map <leader>
  - :map <Leader>m
  - :map j
  - :map <F5>
  - :unmap <key> (reset a mapping), :iunmap <key>
  - :help :unmap
  - Remember that some key combinations are equivalent,Because of the hexadecimal codes that are produced some key combinations will be interpreted by Vim as another key.
    - For example:
      - <C-h> is same as <backspace>
      - <C-j> is same as <enter>
      - <C-S-a> is same as <C-a>
  - Check that your leader is CORRECTly defined:
    - Leader must be defined before the definiton of the mappings
    - Use space bar as leader, should be defined as: let mapleader="\<Space>"
